# Stock Market Price Prediction

Predicting the S&P 500 Index using Machine Learning

# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the price of the S&P 500 stock market index using machine learning techniques. It involves data collection, model training, and backtesting to evaluate predictive accuracy.

## Key Features

* Data Collection: Fetches historical stock data using yfinance.
* Machine Learning Model: Implements a predictive model to estimate future stock prices.
* Backtesting Engine: Evaluates model performance in a real-world trading scenario.
* Model Optimization: Enhances accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

# Project Structure

* market_prediction.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation.
* sp500.csv - Dataset used for training and testing the model.

File overview:

* `market_prediction.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code.

# Local Setup

## Installation

To follow this project, please install the following locally:

* JupyerLab
* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
    * pandas
    * yfinance
    * scikit-learn

## Data

The dataset is retrieved using Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`), ensuring up-to-date and real-world stock market data.

# Model Training & Evaluation

* Load Data - Download historical stock prices.
* Preprocess Data - Feature engineering and data transformation.
* Train Model - Fit a machine learning model on stock market data.
* Backtest Model - Evaluate accuracy with a custom backtesting engine.
* Optimize Performance - Fine-tune parameters for improved predictions

# Results & Insights

* Achieved a [describe performance metrics here, e.g., RMSE, accuracy, etc.].
* Showcased trends and patterns in historical S&P 500 movements.
* Demonstrated the feasibility of machine learning in market forecasting.

# Why This Project Stands Out

* Real-World Application - Uses live financial data for predictions.
* Comprehensive Analysis - Incorporates both predictive modeling and backtesting.
* Scalability - Can be extended to other financial indices or assets.

# Future Enhancements

* Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs).
* Enhance feature selection for better accuracy.
* Integrate real-time stock price monitoring.
